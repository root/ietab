**IE Tab**, an extension from [Taiwan](http://www.taiwan.net.tw/), embeds Internet Explorer in a Mozilla/Firefox tab. This extension is originally hosted on http://ietab.mozdev.org/. Now we moved it here.

While there exists many derived extensions based on IE Tab, we keep the original one here and we're prepared to continue the development.

Believe it or not, we really ran Windows Update from Mozilla/Firefox.
